# Expensify (React study project # 1)
- Web app that tracks expenses

## Key Features
- Tracks expenses
- User can add new expenses
- Expenses are filtered by year, and displayed by month using a bar chart

## What I've learned
- React
  - Structure
  - Components </br>
    React uses a declarative approach for building the components. In plain JavaScript, you write the concrete DOM updating instructions
    on your own. For example:
    ```javascript
    const para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'This is a paragraph';
    document.getElementById('someid').append(para);
    ```
    With React, developer define the desired target state. React then figures out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions. You essentially build your custom HTML Elements, using JavaScript - and a special React syntax called JSX, that looks like the love child of JavaScript and HTML.
