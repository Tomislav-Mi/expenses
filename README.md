## What I've learned
- **REACT**</br>
  - **Components** </br>
    All UI can be split into components. A Button, for instance, can be a component, an input element as well, same goes for filters, and containers, and other pieces of UI. React is all about these components. </br> But what are React components in code? Components are, in-essence, JavaScript functions (or classes) combined with HTML and CSS.
    Before we dive deeper into React components, let's take a quick look at good old vanilla JavaScript. In pure JS (no library or framework attached), you write the concrete DOM updating instructions
    on your own. For example:
    ```javascript
    const para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'Paragraph';
    document.getElementById('someid').append(para);
    ```
    React favours a declarative approach for building the components: Developer define the desired target state, and React then figures out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions. You essentially build your custom HTML Elements with JavaScript and a special React syntax called JSX that looks like the love child of JavaScript and HTML. To render a paragraph in React, you `return` HTML code inside of a function or class. This only works because there are transformation steps running behind the scenes. Here's a React component:[^1]
    ```javascript
    const Para = () => {
      let para = 'Paragraph';
      
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{para}</p>
        </div>
        );
     }
    ```
    </br>
  - **Event Listening, React State, useState( )**</br>
    To react to events in React (no pun intended), we go to the JSX element, for instance</br> `<button>Click!</button>`, and there we add a special prop that starts with `on`, for example `onClick`:
     ```javascript
    const Button = () => {
      let para = 'Paragraph';
      
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{para}</p>
          <button onClick={clickHandler}>Click!</button>
        </div>
        );
      }
    ```
    You probably noticed that I assigned a value to this click event, `{clickHandler}`. That's a pointer to a function that we can declare inside the component *before* the function is returned:
     ```javascript
    const Button = () => {
      let para = 'Paragraph';
      
      const clickHandler = () => {
        console.log('Clicked!');
       } 
    
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{para}</p>
          <button onClick={clickHandler}>Click!</button>
        </div>
        );
     }
    ```
    Now we can react to events.</br></br>
    Let's say we want to give the variable `para` a new value when we click the button. Since this is still JavaScript, you can just assign a new value to `para` inside `clickHandler()`:
    ```javascript
    const Button = () => {
      let para = 'Paragraph';
      
      const clickHandler = () => {
        para = 'New paragraph';
       } 
    
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{para}</p>
          <button onClick={clickHandler}>Click!</button>
        </div>
        );
     }
    ```
    **BUT THAT _WON'T_ WORK!** Don't get me wrong, the variable will receive a new value but React won't render it onto the screen. To show the new value, we need to save the state of the new value with a special React function, the so-called `useState()`. First, we declare a state variable by calling `useState()`. Then, we need to call `setPara()` with a new value inside, i. e. `setPara('NEW VALUE')`. The call must, of course, occur in `clickHandler()`.
     ```javascript
    const Button = () => {
      const [para, setPara] = useState('Paragraph');
      
      const clickHandler = () => {
        setPara('New paragraph');
       } 
    
      return (
        <div>
          <p>{para}</p>
          <button onClick={clickHandler}>Click!</button>
        </div>
        );
     }
    ```
